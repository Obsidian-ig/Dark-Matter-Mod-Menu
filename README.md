# Dark Matter Mod Menu

The source code to my mod menu dark matter. Join the [discord](https://discord.gg/qzpAPzXAe2)!

## Why Go Open Source?
So I decided to make my menu open source, because like iidk I wish for the modding community to go back to the way it was before were everything was open source and free! I feel as though now the modding community has gotten very toxic and un-welcoming. With all these little kids "doxing" people thinking they are cool. I just think it's sad that people actually think they are cool for doing stuff like that. Also even though I don't support skidding unless given permission or someone posted there code in a #post-code discord channel. It's gotten to be a problem enough were people are nuking other peoples servers and cracking other peoples menus. I just think the scene has gotten a little over competitive. If you see someone who leaked someone elses menu, cracked a menu, shared someones ip, address, phone number or other private info please report them and there message and help bring the modding community back to what it was before!
## No Stealing
You are not allowed to copy/paste and code from the source code without first asking me for my permission to use the code. I would be glad to help with your inqueries about the code and how it works! Also I don't mind you asking if you can take code from the menu so don't be shy. IF the code in the menu was given by someone else, such as the projectile gun and projectile function. Please ask the creator instead of me for it. I was given permission by the original coder, to use it.
